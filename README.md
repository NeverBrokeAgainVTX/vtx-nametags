# skyline-nametags
Heres a little nametags script i made, its based off of The Towns nametag script. Be on the lookout tho, ill release my new one soon!

How to add to your server:

Download the script, after doing so make a folder in your /resources folder called [nametags] *or something you will remember
Then add the nametags script into that folder, once done so go into your config.cfg and add "ensure [nametags]" to it!
